Description
------------

UNO is a commercial version of Crazy Eights, a public domain card game played with a standard deck of playing cards. Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in their hand, which score points. 

Rules
-----

* At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt by 7 cards (randomly). The remaining cards are put face down - this is the deck *Widdie*. 

* The top card from the deck *Widdie* is turned over, put next to and becomes the first card of the "Discard" deck.

* The game starts *clockwise*. The first player is after the dealer (the dealer changes each round, usually clockwise). During his turn, the player has the right to lay one card on the "Discard" deck according to the following rules:
    + The card should be the same colour.
    + The card must have the same digit, or the same picture (be active), or be a black active card.
    + In the absence of a suitable card, the player takes one card from the deck *Widdie*. If the card meets the above two conditions - the player can put the card on the deck *Discard*, if not satisfied - the player leaves the card himself, says "Pass" and the turn goes to the next player.

* The game continues until one of the players discards all the cards. After that, the points are calculated by the remaining cards with the other players.

* The winner of the game is decided based on the points after playing the game for certain amount of rounds.
